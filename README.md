# mtcn-deep3d
This script extracts facial landmarks using MTCNN for use with [Deep3DFaceReconstruction](https://github.com/microsoft/Deep3DFaceReconstruction).
Have yet to add arguments, for now, just supply the image name and it's extension once prompted and it will output the landmarks to a text file of the same name.
